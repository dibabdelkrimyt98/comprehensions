# comprehensions

Mapping key-values to Dictionary data structures 
Python has different techniques to modify a given iterator sequence such as list or dictionary using comprehensions, map() function and so on. Now you will be utilising what you have learned. Letâ€™s say you have a list of employee data for the Little Lemon company. You want to create login accounts for the employees and you will create usernames for these employees in the first example. 

You also want to update the roster for these employees on the calendar and want easy access to their initials and employee IDs, as they are all unique. To get that, in the second example, you will create a dictionary with the required information.
